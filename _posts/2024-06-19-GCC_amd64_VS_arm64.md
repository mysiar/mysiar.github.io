I had to compile the same library with code in C to two different platforms
* amd64
* arm64
Luckily I had some unit tests covering functions in the library.

Found out that some floating point calculation were different between amd64 & arm64 architectures.

Initial GCC compiler flags were 
* amd64 `-x c -m64 -Qn -O2 -fPIC`
* arm64 `x c -Qn -O2 -fPIC`

After some tests additional flag `-ffp-contract=off` was added to arm64 compilation that solved the problem

Final arm64 compiler flags `-x c -Qn -O2 -fPIC -ffp-contract=off`
